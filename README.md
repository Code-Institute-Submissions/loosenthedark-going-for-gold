The official Tokyo 2020 font was developed by [Morisawa](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/morisawa-official-font-tokyo-2020), a Japanese type foundry, and appears to be unavailable for public use. After a bit of digging, I therefore decided to use the [Freeroad Regular font](https://webfonts.ffonts.net/Freeroad-Regular.font), which is a close approximation of the ["industrial sans serif"](https://fontmeme.com/images/TOKYO-2020-NEW.gif) seen in the Games' [(redesigned)](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/25/tokyo-2020-organisers-unveil-new-logo-olympic-plagiarism-allegations) [logo](https://fontmeme.com/images/TOKYO-2020-NEW.gif).

## Features

### Potential future features:

- Expand the scope of the project to also incorporate the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games

- The flag images returned from the REST Countries API are not of uniform dimensions, which presents challenges in terms of layout. This is something that could be addressed further down the line, e.g. by applying dynamic styling to the `.flag-wrapper` elements and their contents to ensure standardised width/height for each double-sided flag.
